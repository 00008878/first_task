# Example 1
def age_function(age):
    print(age)


# age_function("10")
# parameter is the "age" written in parenthesis, where argument is the actual number while calling the function

# Example 2
var_age = 10
age_function(var_age)
# This is variable
age_function(5+5)
# and this one is expression

# Example 3
def local_variable():
 someVariable = "Hello world"
 return

# print(someVariable)
# It won't work because of the scope!
